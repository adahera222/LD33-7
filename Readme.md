-------------------------

### Game Idea

It is a Osmos/Spore/CellCraft/Flow combination.
You will only get one (biological) cell.
But you can improve your cell!
Collect useful things like chloroplasts, cell membran parts, energy storages and more useful things.
At first you are only a little core that has a little energy storage and can be moved. But be careful 
moving consumes energy. If your internal energy is depleted you won't be able to move anymore.
So you have to collect and/or produce more energy.


### Stack

* FlashDevelop
* ActionScript3
* Ash Framework
* Data Structures For Games (http://polygonal.github.io/ds/)
* SmartGit
* bfxr (http://www.bfxr.net/)
* AudaCity

### Todo
* moving without energy consumption?
* mouse interaction? is implemented, but didnt feel right - maybe I can improve that
* attract functionality for player? (left click)
* repel functionality for player? (right click)

* rename membran to membrane
* membrane connections should break when distance is to big
* sometimes the mover is like glued to membrane parts, figure out why


* add MembranPart entities that connect to each other at their two ends

* add randomly distorted vector field that has influence on moving things to simulate a dynamic primeval soup

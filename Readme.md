-------------------------

### Game Idea

It is a Osmos/Spore/CellCraft/Flow combination.
You will only get one (biological) cell.
But you can improve your cell!
Collect useful things like chloroplasts, cell membran parts, energy storages and more useful things.
At first you are only a little core that has a little energy storage and can be moved. But be careful 
moving consumes energy. If your internal energy is depleted you won't be able to move anymore.
So you have to collect and/or produce more energy.
